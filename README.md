# Footballers Rating Prediction
This project involves developing a system to predict football players' ratings using various statistical indicators. The data for analysis was obtained in CSV format and organized in a staging area model for initial processing. A data warehouse model was created, and clean, structured data was loaded through ETL processes. Data cleaning was performed to remove outliers and inaccurate entries.

The following algorithms were used for prediction models:
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbours Regression

Statistical features impacting player ratings were explored, and optimal parameters were selected where applicable. Data was split into training and testing sets for model validation.
After building the models, predictions were made, results were evaluated using relevant metrics, and visualizations were created to compare the performance of different models.
